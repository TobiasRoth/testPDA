## Linear regression
Linear regression is the basis of a large part of applied statistical analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) can be considered special cases of linear regression, and generalized linear models are extensions of linear regression. We, therefore, start with a rather detailed introduction to linear regression.

Typical questions that can be answered using linear regression are: How does `y` change with changes in `x`? How is y predicted from `x`? An ordinary linear regression (i.e., one numeric `x` and one numeric `y` variable) can be represented by a scatterplot of `y` against `x`. We search for the line that Ô¨Åts best and describe how the observations scatter around this regression line, that is, we describe the distribution of the residuals $\epsilon_i=y_i-\hat{y}_i$ \@ref(fig:test). 

The model formula of a simple linear regression is:

In other words: the observation y i stems from a normal distribution with b b mean y i and variance s 2 . The mean, y i , equals the sum of the intercept (b 0 ) and the product of the slope (b 1 ) and the predictor value, x i . Equivalently, the regression could be written as:
